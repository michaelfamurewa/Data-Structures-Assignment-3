# Data-Structures-Assignment-3

The queue class can be instantiated with any data type by using the class name followed by the variable name.
Eg. queue<int> exampleQueue;

queue functions are as follows:

push(): Adds an element to the end of the queue
pop(): removes the element at the front of the queue
empty(): returns true if the queue is empty and false otherwise
front(): returns the element at the front of the queue;
moveToRear(); moves the element at the front of the queue to the end and shift the other elements up.

The linear_search() function takes 3 parameters a vector/array, a target and an index that represents the size of the vector/array - 1 since it works backwards.

The insertionSort() function takes a vector/array and sorts it in ascending order.
